    "# Tutorial 0: setting up a git repo\n",
    "\n",
    "This covers some very elementary aspects of creating and working with a git repo\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "1) You should have git installed on your machine\n",
    "\n",
    "(an elementary knowledge of navigating the command line interface is not essential but will help)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Note:\n",
    "\n",
    "I am creating this on a mac. There will be some slight differences in windows, but linux is identical. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Create a local repo!\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's create a convenient folder to hold our new repo. I went to my home directory (on my macbook) and created a folder there called `NXSTestRepo` and opened a terminal there.\n",
    "\n",
    "I did this on the command line by opening a terminal and typing: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "> mkdir ~/NXSTestRepo\n",
    "> cd ~/NXSTestRepo\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "From inside the folder, it can be converted into a git repo with the line:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "> git init\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To prove that this is a git repo, we can type:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "> git status\n",
    "```\n",
    "We will see the following output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "On branch main\n",
    "\n",
    "No commits yet\n",
    "\n",
    "nothing to commit (create/copy files and use \"git add\" to track)\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Step 2:  Add a file to the repo\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's add a simple text file called `content.txt` that contains the string:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "First draft\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be done in several ways. You can use your favourite text editor or a command line editor.\n",
    "\n",
    "in the terminal the `ls` command will now show the file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "> ls \n",
    "contents.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, if we again check the git status, we get the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "> git status\n",
    "On branch main\n",
    "\n",
    "No commits yet\n",
    "\n",
    "Untracked files:\n",
    "  (use \"git add <file>...\" to include in what will be committed)\n",
    "\tcontents.txt\n",
    "\n",
    "nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use \"git add\" to track)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "git is telling us that that there is a file in the repo but it is \"untracked\", that means that git is not monitoring it as it changes. In order to make git aware of the file, we must add it using\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "> git add contents.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "or, in macOS or linux\n",
    "```\n",
    "> git add .\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "will add all files in the directory\n",
    "\n",
    "Now if we check the status, we see\n",
    "```\n",
    "> git status\n",
    "On branch main\n",
    "\n",
    "No commits yet\n",
    "\n",
    "Changes to be committed:\n",
    "  (use \"git rm --cached <file>...\" to unstage)\n",
    "\tnew file:   contents.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "by adding the file, git is now aware that a change to the repo has occured: there is a new file in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, note that git tells us that we are on branch \"main\". We'll come back to branches below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: make your first commit!\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say at this point you've completed your first draft and want to take a snapshot of the entire repo that you can return to at any time. This means you're ready to \"commit\" your work to the repo. In order to keep track of the work you're commiting, git requires that a description, or message is added when a commit is made. It is recommend to keep this short and concise.\n",
    "\n",
    "The command to commitis just `git commit` but doing this will automatically open the default (command line) text editor to enter the commit message. You can skip this and commit in a single step by using `-m` and adding your messages in quotation marks afterwards:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "> git commit -m \"my first draft\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: make your first branch!\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you're first branch is committed, you're ready to start editing to work on your second draft. In order to keep your already committed work safe, you should create a new branch, which I will imaginatively call \"b2\".\n",
    "\n",
    "You will also want to move from the default branch `main` to the new branch `b2` an operation which git calls \"checking out\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The short hand command to both create a new branch 'b2' and then to check it out is: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "> git checkout -b d2\n",
    "Switched to a new branch 'b2'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "at this point the git status shows\n",
    "```\n",
    "> git status\n",
    "On branch b2\n",
    "nothing to commit, working tree clean\n",
    "```\n",
    "We haven't made any edits yet. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now edit out file and add a new line \"Second draft\". Since git is already aware of this file (because it was previously commited to the repo) and it detects a change happened an a status check will show\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "> git status\n",
    "Changes not staged for commit:\n",
    "  (use \"git add <file>...\" to update what will be committed)\n",
    "  (use \"git restore <file>...\" to discard changes in working directory)\n",
    "\tmodified:   content.txt\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Once we've finished our edits and are happy with our second draft we would then commit our changes. First we must again add these, and then they can be committed \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "> git add .\n",
    "> git commit -m \"finished second draft\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "or, in a single line\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "> git add -a -m \"finished second draft\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "You've created your second branch\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5: moving between branches\n",
    "\n",
    "You can look at all the branches in your repo using the command branch:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "> git branch\n",
    "* b2\n",
    "  main\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Which tells us the names of the two branches, with the asterisk indicating we are currently in (i.e. have checked out) branch b2\n",
    "\n",
    "In macOS (or linux) the contents of a file can be displayed with the command `more`. So we can look at what out file contains using: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "> more content.txt\n",
    "First draft\n",
    "Second draft\n",
    "content.txt (END)\n",
    "```\n",
    "However, let's assume we made a horrible mistake in our edits to the second draft and accidentally deleted a bunch of content we now want to recover! In git, this is as simple as checking out the original branch:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "> git checkout main\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If we now look at the contents of our file, it has returned to its original state\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "> more content.txt\n",
    "First draft\n",
    "content.txt (END)\n",
    "```\n",
    "phew! we've recovered exactly where we were in the project before we started working on branch b2\n",
    "\n",
    "When creating code, branching is a very effective way to test new features or bug fixes without the risk of breaking anything.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 6: merging branches. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say our edits in b2 are complete, committed and we're happy with the result. We might want to \"merge\" these changes into the main branch (which is the branch we will eventually publish, or release, when it's done)\n",
    "\n",
    "The command to do this is: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "> git checkout main\n",
    "> git merge b2\n",
    "Updating c343fff..c097601\n",
    "Fast-forward\n",
    " content.txt | 1 +\n",
    " 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "git is telling us that our merge has led to 1 file being changed by a single insertion. Now our file `content.txt` is identical in both branches. If we like, we can now delete our branch b2 using\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "> git branch -d b2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Follow up work: Collaboration using GitHub\n",
    "\n",
    "Hosting sites such as GitHub unlock the potential for collaboration in generating scientific software by allowing multiple people to contribute to code by checking our their own branches. GitHub also allows all changes arising during the merge option to be reviewed and controlled via the mechanism of a pull request. This allows the maintenance of a stable, released software in parallel to continually updates and improvements in separate branches. \n",
    "\n",
    "For a follow up exercise: \n",
    "\n",
    "1) Create a GitHub account\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Push the local repo you have just created to a its remote server\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Link up with a partner who has also done this\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Clone *your partner's* repo to create a local copy of it\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Create a fresh branch and make some edits\n",
    "\n",
    "6) Create a Pull Request in your partner's repo on GitHub to ask them to accept (\"pull\") your modification into their repo. \n",
    "\n",
